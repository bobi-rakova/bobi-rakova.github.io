                    <p>Here's the abstract:<br /> 
                    The use of software in the Industry is becoming the competitive differentiator in new
product development. Software has the ability to create new and better services and help
people and machines achieve better KPIs. In the field of Industry Equipment Manufacturers,
efficiency is king - for them and for their customers. The latest technological advancements
can bring even more efficiency through utilizing integrated software platforms and complex
data analytics. Using Statistics and Machine Learning algorithms to analyze data is the only
way to bring the most value to the OEMs almost out-of-the-box. There are data analytics
algorithms that can help at different levels of the software system. HutGripâ€™s solution
provides a software infrastructure and data analytics focused in two key directions -
forecasting in order to prevent potential costly failures and anomaly detection. </p>

            combined both technical and
            business/customer development
            responsibilities.
