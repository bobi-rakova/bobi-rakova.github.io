Happy New Year! <br />
Wishing you a symmetry of vibrant Singularities,<br />
glowing in the warm mountain home, <br />
giving life to a never dying fireplace!
</p><p>
Silence and peace in the darkest nights.<br />
A galaxy of sparkling free particles, <br />
Armies of (e)merging fantasy worlds!
</p><p>
Laying down underneath the Christmas tree,<br />
A fractal world unveils before a pair of eyes that see.<br />
Love and light to you and all, hopeful, <br />
for the happiest year of all!!!

People's lives, like rays of sunshine.<br />
Streams of photons find their unique pathways.<br />
Ancient DNA Origami conquistadors,<br />
African tribes explorers,<br />
Cryptolife sons of Orion, based in Monaco,<br />
Transformational experiences in Oaxaca Mexico.<br />
Private Space companies, Singularities,<br />
Treehouse-builders, fancy oil vaporizers, cannabis gum!<br />
Quantum computers, belief networks and AI workers.<br />
Life is infinite in all it's forms, awe and wonder!<br />
Feeling grateful to tangent such rich alien trajectories<br />
of living, breathing photon streams of positive energies.<br />
In a sip of coffee, I wonder what is it like to be the other.<br />
Not that I fear I don't feel for my own path. What is the path?<br />
When does the one get tired of looking for it?<br />
When does the one decide to make their own?<br />
Not that I fear I am not doing what I should be.<br />
Epigenetic's, that's our curse and virtue!<br />
Listening, that's my biggest hopeful wish for myself and the other!<br />
Not that I fear the I which I write about is completely lost.<br />
Entangled in its own net of words with uncountable meanings.<br />
Just that this I got up on a Friday morning fascinated by the<br />
infinitely complex and beautiful dance of trajectories.<br />
Humans lives in this world and others.

My mind, a bird in a coffin with windows,<br />
one for each mystic side, even some tunneling through time. <br />
Feeling the betavoltaic clash of every single misty particle of life<br />
as it collapses into the surface of my eyes, half open.<br />
I see my neighbors, fellow alien forms of all energy forms. <br />
Yes, Mr. Bones. Why, where, who... what happened?<br />
My hearth, I wish I could hear it beating.<br />
I hope it's in there, lost somewhere, a scintillating warrior.<br />
Faced against its own battle in a battlefield, not well defined.<br />
Against a distant tribe, In a world, not well described.<br />
Armed with nothing but her beating hearth, the lioness hunts.<br />
Transformed by the infinity in her, the omniscient hearth.<br />
Life is much more than a line of code, a lion, locked in a coffin.

Windows dancing in the Sky.<br />
The empty frames, like goasts swing between the clouds.<br />
Am I the only one to see them? Am I mad to want to reach them,<br />
Only to catch them and put them on the ground once more.
</p><p>
Who am I to judge the flying bricks, to say where’s up or down?<br />
Am I not living in a house flying in the sky as well?<br />
Looking down into the densely populated fractal awesomeness!!<br />
Oh, how I love the view from here! …feeling dizzy in the swing.
</p><p>
Breath in once more, in the endless spin,<br />
Trying to hold on to the dancing windows,<br />
You see through the deadly water vortices at last.
</p><p>
No tear, no sound, no thought ...as you realize,<br />
The only way away is to let the windows go.<br />
Why struggle when you can enjoy their beauty in the sky.

Therefore it doesn’t have any idea about language and words and if the model is not elaborate enough, it will make a lot of typos too. Here’s the output which truly doesn’t make much sense:</p>

                        Yes, yes! You do have dragon wings, says your hearth.<br />
                        Fly far, fly high, fly dragon, fly to freeze the World!</p>

                        <p>And when you succeed, winging your dragon wings,<br />
                        Flip flop flap, how beautiful, how powerful they are.<br />
                        Fractal entrance into another divinity<br />
                        As loaded gunshots, the raindrops has seized their fall <br />
                        in the deep tropical forrest of your Sunday morning.</p>

                        <p>We roam as fleets of musketeers<br />
                        Armed with the never sleeping hunger <br />
                        of building walls around -<br />
                        putting things in boxes<br />
                        Yet we dream of the marvelous escape<br />
                        To walk away from oneself to find the true self.</p>

                        <p>In a sudden instant of infinity<br />
                        we foresee - there’s no exit from the battle<br />
                        We sigh and smile to our hearts<br />
                        that you cannot touch the moon<br />
                        while anxiously staring at the finger <br />

                        There's music in my ears as I see them dancing in their random pathway.<br />
                        Through highways of synapses between billions of neurons: “Weeeweweee”,<br />
                        in the brain of an unexplored universe they fly, firing their soulful wishes away. </p>

                        <p>As the Sun they guide us in our inner search of the true Truth<br />
                        Oh, how I love the fractal nature of our friends, the Snowflakes<br />
                        So successful in their cosmic mission to always remind us of the cold. <br />
                        Longing, as we see them disappear, marching, as they defy and define us.<br />
                        While in an instance, we marvel at their beauty and kill them with our inner fire. </p>

                        <p>Why would you need a wind tunnel when you have supercomputing?<br />
                        That monster, which once was the top of all high tech inventions<br />
                        a product of so much science, engineering, dreaming…<br />
                        yet its magnificence in the distance strikes you as an Ocean of tensor dimensions.</p>

                        <p>Swim, swim little fish, swim in that Ocean of fictions.<br />
                        As you alone and only you can find a way through.<br />
                        Is it you, is it the flow… as if someone is giving directions?<br />
                        But there’s the trap, there’s no way out - it’s a soup!<br />
                        However hard you stir - <br />
                        you might spill a bit, you might sip a bit only to end up back in the soup.</p>

                        <p>Why is it that it’s so hard to get out of the bowl of soup?<br />
                        A leap of faith? There might be other bowls out there?<br />
                        3 billion variances in the human genome <br />
                        and yet just one bowl, my bowl…</p>

                        <p>If I was a fish I’d be a flying one. So that,<br />
                        I can swim through the bowl of soup and then fly into the next one!<br />
                        Millions, billions bowls of soup as if we’re not all made out of water,<br />
                        as if we’re not all practically one(big bowl of fish soup)!  </p>
