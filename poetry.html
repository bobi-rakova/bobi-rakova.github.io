                    <p>The following poem is based on a recurrent neural network which has been trained on only a small amount of Shakespeare's work and is building a model that predicts the next character based on previously seen characters. Therefore it doesn’t have any idea about language and words and if the model is not elaborate enough, it will make a lot of typos too. Here’s the output which truly doesn’t make much sense:</p>

                        <p>Snowflakes of infinite dimensions, ancient bullets of frozen H2O, <br />
                        Like a never ending rays of sunshine - screaming, flying, all towards me, <br />
                        There's music in my ears as I see them dancing in their random pathway.<br />
                        Through highways of synapses between billions of neurons: “Weeeweweee”,<br />
                        in the brain of an unexplored universe they fly, firing their soulful wishes away. </p>

                        <p>As the Sun they guide us in our inner search of the true Truth<br />
                        Oh, how I love the fractal nature of our friends, the Snowflakes<br />
                        So successful in their cosmic mission to always remind us of the cold. <br />
                        Longing, as we see them disappear, marching, as they defy and define us.<br />
                        While in an instance, we marvel at their beauty and kill them with our inner fire. </p>

                        <p>Illusion works impenetrable,<br />
                        Weaving webs innumerable,<br />
                        Her gay pictures never fail,<br />
                        Crowds each on other, veil on veil,<br />
                        Charmer who will be believed<br />
                        By man who thirsts to be deceived.</p>

                        Illusions like the tints of pearl,<br />
                        Or changing colors of the sky,<br />
                        Or ribbons of a dancing girl<br />
                        That mend her beauty to the eye.</p>

                        <p>The cold gray down upon the quinces lieth<br />
                        And the poor spinners weave their webs thereon<br />
                        To share the sunshine that so spicy is.</p>

                        <p>Samson stark, at Dagon's knee,<br />
                        Gropes for columns strong as he;<br />
                        When his ringlets grew and curled,<br />
                        Groped for axle of the world.</p>

                        <p>But Nature whistled with all her winds,<br />
                        Did as she pleased and went her way.</p>

                        <p>Why would you need a wind tunnel when you have supercomputing?<br />
                        That monster, which once was the top of all high tech inventions<br />
                        a product of so much science, engineering, dreaming…<br />
                        yet its magnificence in the distance strikes you as an Ocean of tensor dimensions.</p>
                         
                        <p>Swim, swim little fish, swim in that Ocean of fictions.<br />
                        As you alone and only you can find a way through.<br />
                        Is it you, is it the flow… as if someone is giving directions?<br />
                        But there’s the trap, there’s no way out - it’s a soup!<br />
                        However hard you stir - <br />
                        you might spill a bit, you might sip a bit only to end up back in the soup.</p>

                        <p>Why is it that it’s so hard to get out of the bowl of soup?<br />
                        A leap of faith? There might be other bowls out there?<br />
                        3 billion variances in the human genome <br />
                        and yet just one bowl, my bowl…</p>

                        <p>If I was a fish I’d be a flying one. So that,<br />
                        I can swim through the bowl of soup and then fly into the next one!<br />
                        Millions, billions bowls of soup as if we’re not all made out of water,<br />
                        as if we’re not all practically one(big bowl of fish soup)!  </p>
