      Learning from the field of Participatory Relational Design, we investigate what can we learn from the design of social movements (specifically in the Global South) about the way we work to ensure better alignment between AI systems and human and ecological well-being.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/challenges-for-responsible-ai-practitioners/">Challenges for Responsible AI Practitioners and the Importance of Solidarity</a> - common obstacles faced by the practitioners we interviewed included lack of accountability, ill-informed performance trade-offs, and misalignment of incentives within decision-making structures. These obstacles can be understood as a result of how organizations answer four key questions: When and how do we act? How do we measure success? What are the internal structures we rely on? And how do we resolve tensions? These are questions that every organization must have a process for answering when developing responsible AI practices. We employed a systems thinking forecasting activity to map the possible paths forward, which we describe in our CSCW publication <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3449081">here</a>.
