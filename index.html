            <h3>Building Agentic AI Systems Evaluation Pipelines through Legal Red-Teaming, Standardization, and Mechanism Design</h3>
            <p> 
              <!-- I started out as a Computer Scientist, Machine Learning engineer, and researcher, now doing work at the intersection with Science and Technology Studies and Computational Law.   -->
            

            Bogdana (Bobbi) is a senior data scientist at the global <b>Responsible AI team at DLA Piper,</b> where her work is focused on legal red-teaming and safety guardrails. Her research centers algorithmic impact assessments, participatory mechanism design, legal innovation, and the use of speculative methods to explore a wide range of possible futures. She is also a <b>Data & Society Institute</b> affiliate and has a passion for empowering people to trust AI systems through actionable models of evaluation and engagement in the AI lifecycle, centered on equity, access, and justice.

            Previously, a senior trustworthy AI fellow at the <b>Mozilla Foundation (2022-24)</b>, working on <a href="https://bobi-rakova.medium.com/reimagining-consent-and-contestability-in-ai-56979a88a7fb">reimagining consent and contestability in AI</a>. A research manager at the <a href="https://www.accenture.com/us-en/insights/artificial-intelligence/responsible-ai-principles-practice">Responsible AI team at Accenture</a> where she worked on bringing the latest research on AI impact assessments into practice for diverse clients.
               
                Bobbi is a lead guest editor of the Springer journal  Special Issue: <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/42413/volumes-and-issues/3-4">Intersections of Artificial Intelligence and Community Well-Being</a>.
                As a research fellow at <a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/challenges-for-responsible-ai-practitioners/">Partnership on AI</a>, she worked on disentangling the intersection of organizational structure and the work within the growing field of Responsible AI.

                Bobbi is passionate about the intersection of AI, community well-being, and environmental regeneration, also as part of the <a href="https://www.happycounts.org/">Happiness Alliance</a>.
                She was part of the core team who brought together the <a href="https://beyondstandards.ieee.org/ieee-7010-2020-launch-prioritizes-human-well-being-and-environmental-sustainability-via-technology/"> IEEE 7010-2020 Recommended Practice for Assessing the Impact of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems on Human Well-Being</a>.

How do we eliminate "bad" friction and build in "good" friction that creates space for constructive dialogue, understanding, transparency, learning, and care, in the context of generative AI adoption within specific domains? Who gets to decide what is "good" and "bad" friction and how is this related to design choices such as seams, explainability, human-centered design, and human agency, as well as algorithmic auditing, evaluation, and improving safety for algorithmic systems?

            <h4>Sustainability, justice, and socio-ecological dimensions of AI</h4>
            <h5>March, 2022 - ongoing</h5>
            <p>What if we could explore the complex dynamic relationship between technical AI artifacts and environmental ecosystems by <a href="https://branch.climateaction.tech/issues/issue-4/slowing-down-ai-with-speculative-friction/">slowing down AI with speculative friction</a>? To explore this question, I co-organized an interdisciplinary workshop on <a href="https://ecosystemic-ai.github.io/">the (eco)systemic challenges in AI</a> at the Hybrid Human AI Conference in Amsterdam, June 14th 2022. Our goal was to center socio-ecological perspectives in the design, development, and deployment of AI. 
              On March 24th, 2023, I'm hosting a panel discussion at the Mozilla MozFest event <a href="https://aisustainability.cargo.site/">centered on the emergent need to consider the relationship between algorithmic systems, the sustainability of computing infrastructure, and arguments for climate and environmental justice.</a> How do we empower improved transparency about the carbon footprint of AI systems as well as broader sustainability concerns with regards to their downstream impacts on human decision-making, nonhuman life, and ecosystems? For example, consider environmental and climate justice dimensions of the way AI systems are designed, developed, and deployed in the built environment or the way opaque AI systems contribute to climate misinformation.

            <p><a href="https://www.partnershiponai.org/challenges-for-responsible-ai-practitioners/">Challenges for Responsible AI Practitioners and the Importance of Solidarity</a> - common obstacles faced by the practitioners we interviewed included lack of accountability, ill-informed performance trade-offs, and misalignment of incentives within decision-making structures. These obstacles can be understood as a result of how organizations answer four key questions: When and how do we act? How do we measure success? What are the internal structures we rely on? And how do we resolve tensions? These are questions that every organization must have a process for answering when developing responsible AI practices. We employed a systems thinking forecasting activity to map the possible paths forward, which we describe in our CSCW publication <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3449081">here</a>.
