<p><div class="accent-big">AI Ethics</div> <div class="accent-regular">- together with the development of Narrow and General Intelligence research we need to advance the field of AI Ethics. To understand the moral, ethical, and philosophical impacts that artificial intelligence will have on society and also the effect society will have on our AI sentients.
  The development of this new and growing field has the higest chance of succeeeding if we all take part in shaping it.
  Demanding an interdisciplinary approach is a key perspective for many researchers in the field: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07769.pdf">a blueprint of a course in AI Ethics</a> and the <a href="http://automato.farm/portfolio/ethical-things/">Ethical Things</a> project by <a href="http://research.mchrbn.net/">Matthieu Cherubini</a>. More recent work includes:</div></p>
<p class="accent-regular"> - <a href="https://www.ethicalos.org/">The Ethical OS Framework developed by The Institute for the Future and the Omidyar Network.</a> It is a toolbox and guide for startups and VCs to help them consider the ethical implications of their products. </p>
<p class="accent-regular"> - <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3198732">A framework released by the Oxford Internet Institute.</a> They make the analogy to bioethics and extend that framework by asking a critical question - "are we (humans) the patient, receiving the “treatment” of AI, the doctor prescribing it? Or both? It seems that we must resolve this question before seeking to answer the question of whether the treatment will even work."</p>

<p><div class="accent-big">Language</div> <div class="accent-regular"> - I've been fascinated by linguistics and cognitive science.
 Languages are essential for human intelligence and our cognitive capacity allows us to continuosly come up with new types of knowedge representations.
 AI research have demonstrated that we can create autonomous agents that <a href="https://blog.openai.com/learning-to-cooperate-compete-and-communicate/">cooperate to achieve a common goal and in the process invent their own language</a>.
By taking an interdisciplinary approach, we can experiment with new kinds of probabilistic programming languages
that learn from the comparative power and flexibility of human languages. I think we are in the process of inventing new types of language interfaces(<a href="http://shrdlurn.sidaw.xyz/acl16/">even games</a>) that will change how we interact
between each other, within each other and with our technology. <br /><br />
- In their recent work <a href="http://cbmm.mit.edu/video/building-machines-learn-think-people-prof-josh-tenenbaum-icml2018">"Building Machines that learn and think like people"</a>,
Lake, Ulmanm Tenenbaum and Gershman prototype the building ingridients for moving AI research towards human-like learning, informed by compositionality, causality and learning-to-learn.
Most of all, they suggest that deep
learning and other computational paradigms should aim to use <b>as little training
data as people need</b>, and also as a research community, we should <b>evaluate models on a range of human-like generalizations beyond
the one task the model was trained on</b>.
</div></p>

<p><div class="accent-big">Environmental Sustainability</div> <div class="accent-regular"> - facinated by the concept of the <a href="http://drewpurves.com/">Intelligent Biosphere</a> developed by Drew Purves from Deep Mind. I believe technogy should bring the environment closer to people and not the other way around. I think we need better feedback loops to inspire people to realize their immediate impact on the environment.</div></p>
